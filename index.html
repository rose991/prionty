                <h3>My favorite hobby is travelling. I like all kinds of travel: by car, by train, by plane, and travelling on foot. But I have never travel by the ship yet. Usually, I travel with my parents. Most of all I like to travel by car and spend a little time at different places. Although long journeys are tiring me sometimes, but that doesn't stop me. First of all, it’s always nice to stay in a different place for a change. Secondly, I’m interested in seeing new sights, exploring different cultures and else. Third, I love to spend time in beautiful places and admire the beauty of the natural attractions such as mountains, waterfalls, forest lakes, seas and oceans, forests, valleys, hills, etc. I travelled few beautiful places of my country Bangladesh. I also travelled few other countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Travelling gives me a good opportunity to learn a lot about the history of the country I visit, to see cultural and historical places, to meet people of different nationalities, to learn a lot about their traditions, customs and culture. In other words, I can expand my worldview and my mind. In the future I'm going to visit many countries of the world.</h3>
